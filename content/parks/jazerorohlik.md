Jazero Rohlík is a small lake amid a residential area and a hospital complex in the city district Ružinov. Its surrounding green space offers little infrastructure but plenty of breathing room for residents.

1. Understated natural oasis
2. Paradise for animal lovers
3. Limited diversity in activities

# A hidden gem of urban nature

Jazero Rohlík is particularly popular among nearby residents because of its familiar and non-commercial character. Since the area is rather small and visitors do not come from all over Bratislava, the total number of posts in this location is accordingly low, amounting to just 130[^1].

Locals perceive it as a pleasant and casual green space that serves as a special, “hidden” spot in the district. This is proven by the hashtag #ruzinov being the most popular one, even before #bratislava (3rd). All other locations do not display such a strong connection between the park and the district it’s located in.

Moreover, the location has the highest posts per user ratio (2.06) which may result from the loyalty of frequent visitors or simply reflect the low number of unique users (63) posting from Rohlík.

Nevertheless, it is a non-commercial “green oasis” that inhabitants of the surrounding dense urban environment appreciate for its natural elements. Looking at the categories, visitors appreciate the “nature” and “animals” aspects and lay little importance on rather commercial and artificial features such as “food & events” or “self-promotion”.

And although the location’s landscape is not the most natural and pristine, users perceive it as so vital because of the contrasting urban surroundings. In comparison to the other parks, looking solely at the labels from Google Vision, it has the highest share of posts including built elements such as building (36%), window (8%) and urban design (6%)[^2].

# Adored by animal lovers

Animals play a significant role here as can be seen by the outstanding share of posts that include hashtags related to them (21%). The lake and its surrounding green space offer the perfect conditions for dogs and their owners who are not obligated to put a leash on pets. Pictures of dogs playing in the water or on the lawn alongside the lake are not a rarity in posts from Jazero Rohlík. Google Vision identifies dogs in 20% of all posts and the #dog and #pes (en: dog) hashtags rank among the top 10 most popular. Anglers, too, enjoy visiting Jazero Rohlík to take advantage of the quiet spots around the lake and relax in unique urban nature.

# Narrow spectrum of activities

Jazero Rohlík is not particularly convenient for people wanting to practice a variety of outdoor activities or planning an exciting day outside. The green area is relatively small and there are no cafés, playgrounds or workout zones.

There seems to be no strong incentive for visitors to come with friends or family since this category is rather low (5%) and Google Vision labels “people in nature” in only 11% of all posts. It is more about simply being outside and spending time with yourself and perhaps your dog.

This low spectrum of possible activities could also explain the high percentage of visitors who, besides posting from Jazero Rohlík, also publish content from one or more of the other observed parks. Most likely, these people rely on Rohlík for brief, daily visits, while also enjoying larger parks that satisfy more needs, such as running or biking.
