# Popularity of orange Insta posts

Located on the Petrzalka side of the Danube river bank, Sad Janka Kráľa does not only prevail in size, but also in historical significance. It is the city’s oldest, best known and most visited urban park, which is proven by the enormous amount of Instagram posts, likes and comments.

| public posts | unique users | likes   | comments |
|--------------|--------------|---------|----------|
| 10,424        | 5,953         | 1,002,538 | 21,123[^1]    |

So far, over 10,000 pictures have been shared with the whole world. Among these are numerous posts by leading Slovak influencers, hobby photographers and people who occasionally enjoy posing for a quick photo shooting. Especially in autumn, many Instagram users simply cannot seem to resist holding up a golden leaf in front of their phone camera.

The popularity of self-promotion hashtags, such as #photooftheday, #slovakgirl or #instagood, has been steadily growing. The aesthetic of "flash photography" (14%), and the presence of other Insta-related features like "smile" (15%) or "gesture" (10%), was particularly frequently identified by the Google Vision pattern recognition algorithm[^5]. This also explains the relatively high share of the “self-promotion” and “happiness” categories, a common pattern among aspiring Instagrammers on the hunt for new followers.

# Perfect combination of city and nature

Of the parks examined, Sad Janka Kráľa has the most attractive balance between city and nature. This harmony can be seen in the widely diverse types of activities, from typical weekend walks to picnics to yoga and jogging.

Not only greenery, but also architectural gems attract photographers' attention. Situated on the Danube riverbank, the park is rich in eye-catching landscape features, such as the gothic tower or UFO bridge.

# Ideal place for get-togethers

Sad Janka Kráľa is a social place where people enjoy meeting up with their closest friends, acquaintances and relatives. The perception of kid-friendliness seems to be quite confident since many parents like to take their children or toddlers with them. Visitors sense the positivity generated by the presence of their company, as can be seen in the dominance of the “family and friends” category, as well as its strong intersection with posts indicating “happiness and love”[^2].

Curiously, these declarative sentiments – based on user-generated hashtags – are confirmed by the more matter-of-fact appearances of people detected in pictures by pattern recognition algorithms.

The following chart illustrates the relationship between all categories – each circle represents the number of posts that fall into the selected two topics at the intersection of row and column. It is easy to notice that nature is strongly associated with many other topics – quite obvious, given that it sets the background for other park activities.

# Covid influence

With lockdown and reduced mobility, public parks and forests in many places have peaked in popularity. Did they actually?

According to data from Google Maps, activity in Bratislava&nbsp;I parks in April 2021 has in fact dropped by 22% compared to pre-covid days. At the same time, it grew in neighbouring areas by as much as 4% (BRA II), 41% (BRA III) and 20% (BRA IV)[^3].

This seems obvious, since people have vacated downtown offices and schools, settling into residential districts or more suburban locations. However, among similar parks in central Bratislava[^4] – like Horský park or [Medická záhrada](/services/Medickázahrada/) – only Sad Janka Kráľa has clearly lost its Instagram followers.

# A loyal crowd? Not exactly.

Why the drop in popularity? While we are unaware of the motivations of Instagrammers visiting the park, we can suspect that Sad Janka Kráľa has become a victim of its previous wide appeal to highly diverse audiences.

This is confirmed by the proportion of mutual park goers who published posts from multiple locations. Only 14.5% of Instagrammers at Sad Janka Kráľa also posted from another park – a stark contrast to 38.3% at [Medická záhrada](/services/Medickázahrada/), a similar downtown leisure spot.

Such a low value could be interpreted as loyalty to only one park. But more likely, many of these people were just one-time visitors, possibly downtown tourists or customers of the neighbouring shopping complex.

# What else to know about the park

1. Sad Janka Kráľa apparently offers the perfect setting for all kinds of wedding photo shoots in nature.
2. If you're seeking skateboarding or slackline buddies, be sure to take a look around this park.
3. Unlike other Bratislava parks, Sad Janka Kráľa does not seem to be particularly popular among animal owners.

[^2]: While the correlation is highest for Jazero Rohlík, the value of the "friends and family" category for this park is low. In addition, the sample of posts for Jazero Rohlík is relatively small, so it must be considered with caution.
